This is an event system inspired by an article written by Jeremy Keith (http://adactio.com/journal/5429/) that publishes a jquery custom event when the user resizes the window across responsive breakpoints. The breakpoint name needs to be specified for each media query in the content: attribute of the body:afer psuedo element.
